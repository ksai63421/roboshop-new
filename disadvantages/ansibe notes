ansible
..................

disadvantages
...................


1.shell script is homogeneous 

useradd roboshop ...>centos

adduser....> ubuntu

one shell script can only work one particular distribution

2. every time we need to do validations
3 . if you have 1000 servers, you need to login and run the script 
4. imperative vs declarative 

..> imperative is little tough syntax..> very strict syntax follow th sequence

...> declarative is easy syntax, you can write any where
 
    whatevr you write that will execute


    ansible is declarative

    shell script is imperative


    1. ansible can query the server, it can understand what OS it is, based on that it can change the server.
    2. you no need to write validations
    3. ansible can connect any no of servers, no need to login the server
    4. declarative , no need of sequence easy syntax


    we need to schedule how frequently nodes should connect to server. like once in 30min

Push
--------------
Configuration Server --> Ansible server
1. Server will directly push and run the configuration

LIC
--------
you pay to agent
agent pay to LIC office

LIC
--------
LIC is directly sending notifications about payment

Push vs Pull
-----------
pull mechansim will have additional agent software
there may not be change in configuration every time, change in configuration is very rare wastage of data.

shell script --> keeping all the commands in a file with variables, conditions, loops, etc
playbook --> keeping all the ansible collections(i.e command in linux) and run it

YAML --> yet another markup language
